## Dataset Description & Scope



# Data Dictionary & Editorial Guidelines

## General editorial guidelines

Primarily, the dataset is a "verbatim" transcription of the stock books,
meaning the editors transcribed exactly what was written in the source
materials. However, as with many historical documents, there are
inconsistencies and irregularities. To achieve a high level of accuracy
and clarity, editorial changes were made during and post-transcription:

-   Wherever possible, editors replaced shortcuts such as `do`, `idem`,
    a hashmark (`#`), or double quote mark (`"`) with the actual word or
    name being referenced. 

-   Abbreviations may be spelled out.

-   Titles in brackets were added by PSCP from further research and the
    source of such information is included. The title `[Untitled]` was
    added when a title could not be found. The title `Untitled` without
    brackets is verbatim from the stock book. See the `notes`
    column below for more details about the use of brackets in specific
    fields. 

-   If `<br>` appears in the data, it indicates a link break. This
    may occur in any of fields with `alphabetic` in the `data_type`
    column below.

-   Names of artists, buyers, and sellers of a work are validated by an
    internal authority database, which is the source of authority
    names, nationalities, and locations. Most artists have been
    validated, but a number of buyers and sellers have yet to be fully
    researched so the corresponding authority fields may be empty.

-   Knoedler was not consistent or explicit in their recording of
    purchase and sales prices. As a result, prices may have been entered
    based on context clues as opposed to verbatim. Such prices appear in
    brackets.
