## Dataset description & scope

This dataset contains 40,335 records transcribed from the [11 painting stock books](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/2012m54s1a) and enhanced with information transcribed from the [21 paintings and watercolors sales books](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/2012m54s2ny) of M. Knoedler & Co. in New York (1872-1970).

In general, stock books are administered by galleries and art dealers to record information about works of art that come into their inventories. 
Information from these stock books, of which the Knoedler stock books are a prime example, includes the date of acquisition, name and address of the seller, dimensions of the artwork, name of the buyer, date of sale, and the selling price. 
In this dataset, information obtained from stock books was supplemented with information from the sales books, including buyer and seller names and locations, titles of artworks, and purchase prices not identified in the stock books. 
As such, the dataset may not contain information regarding works that were sent to the Knoedler Gallery on consignment, or objects in other media such as watercolors (although fewer than 600 watercolors are covered in the stock books). 
Most of the information provided is written in English, but some entries are in French, German, or Italian. Some handwritten notes may not be included. 

## General editorial guidelines

Primarily, the dataset is a "verbatim" transcription of the stock books, meaning the editors transcribed exactly what was written in the source materials. 
However, as with many historical documents, there are inconsistencies and irregularities. 
To achieve a high level of accuracy and clarity, editorial changes were made during and post-transcription:

- Wherever possible, editors replaced shortcuts such as "do", "idem", a hashmark (`#`), or double quote mark (`"`) with the actual word or name being referenced. 
- Abbreviations may be spelled out.
- Titles in brackets were added by PSCP from further research and the source of such information is included. The title "`[Untitled]`" was added when a title could not be found. The title "`Untitled`" without brackets is verbatim from the stock book. See the `notes` column below for more details about the use of brackets in specific fields. 
- If `<br>` appears in the data, it indicates a link break. This may occur in any of fields with "alphabetic" in the `data_type` column below.
- Names of artists, buyers, and sellers of a work are validated by an internal authority database, which is the source of authority names, brief names and locations. Most artists have been validated, but a number of buyers and sellers have yet to be fully researched so the corresponding authority fields may be empty.
- Knoedler was not consistent or explicit in their recording of purchase and sales prices. As a result, prices may have been entered based on context clues as opposed to verbatim. Such prices appear in brackets. Also, the sales price of a work may represent the total amount the work sold for, or it may represent only Knoedler's portion of the sale of the jointly owned objects.
